# Falling Cube Tower Simulation #
The blender project incorporates the use of real-time physics to simulate a tower of cubes falling when 
dropped from a high position. To simulate the physics I considered the acceleration due to gravity as 
cubes fell. The cubes also separate as they would naturally. To make this possible, I used blender plugins 
and incorporated python scripts within blender.
